IMDB Movie Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

This project demonstrates my SQL skills through an exploratory data analysis (EDA) of a movie dataset using MySQL. The dataset contains information about movies, genres, ratings, cast, production companies, and more. I explored a variety of business-relevant questions to derive insights and assess data quality.


Skills Demonstrated:
- Complex SQL queries and subqueries
- Aggregate functions (COUNT, SUM, AVG, etc.)
- Window functions (RANK, DENSE_RANK)
- Data cleaning and null analysis
- Joins across multiple tables
- CTEs (Common Table Expressions)
- Case statements and conditional logic
- Text pattern matching (LIKE, UPPER)
- Time-based filtering (year/month/date)

Sample Insights

- USA and India combined produced 1059 movies in 2019.
- Drama is the most common genre.
- "Action" films have the longest average duration.
